- 👋 Hi, I’m `vyketype`, a volunteer developer at [PixliesNet](https://github.com/PixliesEarth), a Minecraft geopolitical server.
- 💞️ I am currently developing a highly-specialized economy/business plugin in Minecraft, [ProtoBusiness](https://github.com/PixliesEarth/PixliesCoreV2/tree/main/ProtoBusiness/src/main).
- 👀 I'm also working on **HYKIR**, a website to practice typing in Western Armenian.
- 🌱 I’m fluent in Java, Python, and Kotlin, although I prefer to use Java.
